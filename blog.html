            <h2> Q.No : 1 - how to deferent var let constant ?</h2>
            <p class="p-4"> Ans : Just like let, const declarations are hoisted to the top but are not initialized.

                So just in case you missed the differences, here they are:

                var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.
                var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not
                re-declared; const
                variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
                They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined,
                let and const
                variables are not initialized.
                While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during
                declaration.</p>

            <h2> Q.No : 2 - how to different arrow and regular function ?</h2>
            <p class="p-4"> Ans : The first and most obvious difference between arrow functions and regular functions is
                their syntax. Not only do they
                look different, but arrow functions also provide an implicit return shorthand and allow parenthesis
                around a single
                argument to be omitted.
                <br>
                Once I started learning JavaScript I realized that functions
                are bread and
                butter of JavaScript programming language.
                Alongside classic function declarations there are arrow functions in JS (introduced in ES6). Arrow
                functions might be
                confusing in the beginning. In fact, arrow functions are great! They do look nicer, they do take less
                keystrokes, they
                are more fun, and they are so handy in React. Let’s take a closer look at their syntax and other
                differences compare to
                regular functions. <br>Instead of the function keyword, arrow function uses an arrow (=>) made up of an
                equal sign and a greater-than character
                (not to be confused with the greater-than-or-equal operator, which is written >=).

                // ES5 Regular function
                let add = function(a, b) {
                return a + b;
                };
                // ES6 Arrow function
                let add = (a, b) => { return a + b };
                It is important to note that arrow functions, introduced in ES6 in 2015, are anonymous, which means that
                they are not
                named. The example above shows the anonymous arrow function with two arguments a and b that returns a +
                b.

                Arrow functions may appear unfamiliar and not very readable at first, but that quickly changes as the
                eyes get used to
                the structure.

                They are very convenient for simple one-line actions, when we’re just too lazy to write many words.

            <h2> Q.No : 3 - how to different map, foreach, filter, find in javascript ?</h2>
            <p class="p-4"> Ans : Filter a Map in JavaScript # Use the forEach () method to filter a Map in JavaScript.
                The method gets called with each
                key-value pair in the Map, where we can check for a condition and use the delete () method to delete any
                of the Map
                elements we want to filter out.

            <h2> Q.No : 1 - how to use template string in java ?</h2>
            <p class="p-4"> Ans :
                The simpliest way to have a string template in java is by using the Apache Commons Lang library which
                you already have
                as a dependency already. Get library Resolve the dependency through maven by defining it in your
                pom.xml.<br> To use the string template approach from Apache Commons Lang library, you first define your
                data with a Map. Then, you
                develop your template via a simple string or load it from a file. The template format is very similar to
                Kotlin String
                Templates, Velocity or Freemarker. The values are defined with the syntax.</p>
